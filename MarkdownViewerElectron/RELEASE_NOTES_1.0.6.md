# Markdown Viewer 1.0.6

## Fixes
- Windows: fix taskbar/Start Menu icon showing as a generic document icon after installation.
  - Ships `markdownviewer.ico` next to the installed EXE (in addition to `resources/`).
  - Makes icon lookup prefer the EXE directory for better shortcut compatibility.

## Notes
- No Winget changes in this release.
