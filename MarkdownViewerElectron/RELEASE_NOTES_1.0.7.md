# Markdown Viewer 1.0.7

## Fixes
- Windows: recreate Start Menu/Desktop shortcuts with a stable icon + working directory.
  - Prevents corrupted shortcut fields (e.g., broken "Start in") that can make the taskbar icon fall back to a generic document icon.

## Notes
- No Winget changes in this release.

## If you pinned an older version
- Unpin the old taskbar icon, then pin again after installing 1.0.7.
